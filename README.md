# maths2opt_platform
Mathematical Programming modelling and optimization platform

### Prerequisites
Please visit the platform using the link below :

https://maths2opt.herokuapp.com/

In order to run an example from the ones provided here, you need to upload first the .tex file provided in the \LaTeX folder (when you click on the horizontal bars you will also render the LaTeX language using MathJax) and the .dat file also provided here in \Data folder. For example, to run the LOBICO model, please use "LOBICO.tex" and "LOBICO.dat" respectivelly.

Once you do that, simply select the solver required from NEOS server from the drop - down list (based on the class of the problem, namely LP, MILP, MIQP, MINLP etc. ) and then input your email in the box right next to it for NEOS to return the solution. Lastly, hit the "Generate and Optimize" button at the end to start.
